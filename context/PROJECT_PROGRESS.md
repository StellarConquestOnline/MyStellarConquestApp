# Stellar Conquest - Project Progress

## DONE

*   **Core App Setup & Styling:**
    *   Next.js project initialization with TypeScript.
    *   ShadCN UI & Tailwind CSS configuration.
    *   Global theme (`globals.css`) based on PRD color scheme.
    *   Firebase and Genkit initialization.
*   **Basic UI Structure:**
    *   `RootLayout`, `HomePage`, `GameClient` components.
    *   Collapsible Sidebar with initial menu items.
    *   Responsive panels for Details, Management, Multiplayer.
*   **Star Map:**
    *   Hex grid, star systems, dust clouds, entry points, visual labels rendering.
    *   Star system selection and basic info display.
    *   `isHexVisible` for map boundaries.
    *   Player-specific colors for map elements.
*   **Multiplayer Foundation (`useGameSessionManagement.ts`):**
    *   Firestore `gameSessions` collection for game creation/joining.
    *   Game code generation, public game listing.
    *   Player name handling.
    *   Local storage for rejoin support.
    *   `playerOrder` randomization and usage.
*   **Turn Management:**
    *   Turn counter, current player tracking.
    *   Production phase logic (Turn 0, interval-based).
    *   PP allocation for production turns.
    *   End turn logic advancing player.
*   **Core Gameplay Features (Initial Implementation):**
    *   Star System Exploration (planet generation, ownership, basic hazards).
    *   Production Panel (building units/structures, allocating research, cost/prereq checks).
    *   Fleet Management Panel (creating task forces from unassigned ships).
    *   Command Post (data structure, initial placement at start locations, rendering as `Flag` icons).
*   **Tutorial AI:**
    *   Dialog and basic Genkit flow for explanations.
*   **Data Management:**
    *   Comprehensive type definitions (`src/types/game.ts`).
    *   Centralized initial game data (`src/data/game-init-data.ts`).
    *   Refinement of `useGameSessionManagement.ts` hook.

## WORKING

*   **Command Post Range Visualization:**
    *   Designing options for visualizing the 8-hex command post range for unit movement (leaning towards subtle overlay + dynamic path warning).

## NEXT

*   **Unit Movement:**
    *   Implement core unit movement logic on the hex grid.
    *   Integrate command post range limits/warnings into movement.
*   **Fog of War:**
    *   Implement hiding of unexplored star systems.
    *   Implement hiding of opponent fleet compositions and detailed locations.
*   **Colony Management (Detailed):**
    *   Implement population growth mechanics.
    *   Implement per-colony Production Point (PP) generation and spending.
    *   Link built planetary items (e.g., factories) to colony output.
*   **Technology System (Full):**
    *   Implement effects of researched technologies (e.g., ship speed bonus, new units).
    *   Enforce research prerequisites strictly.
*   **Combat Mechanics:**
    *   Design and implement fleet-vs-fleet combat.
    *   Design and implement planetary defense and invasion.
*   **Multiplayer Synchronization (Advanced):**
    *   Ensure all relevant game state changes (fleets, system ownership, research progress, colony details, combat outcomes) are reliably synced via Firestore for all players.
*   **Tutorial AI Assistant (Enhancements):**
    *   Potentially add more sophisticated context awareness or tool usage for the AI.
*   **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   Ongoing improvements based on new features.
    *   Address any icon/label overlaps on the Star Map.
*   **Game End Conditions & Scoring.**
