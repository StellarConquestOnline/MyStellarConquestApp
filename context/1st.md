Hello App Prototyper!

This is a new session for our "Stellar Conquest" project. To ensure we're on the same page, please take a moment to load and process the project's context by reading the following files located in the `C:\Users\howel\my-stellar-conquest-app\context\` directory:

1.  **`PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md`**: This file contains a detailed summary of our project goals, features discussed, key decisions made, tasks we've completed, and what we were planning. It's the main narrative of our work.
2.  **`PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`**: This file tracks our tasks, categorized into "DONE", "WORKING", and "NEXT". It will give you a quick overview of our current development status.
3.  **`PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: This file outlines how you should use and help maintain these context files throughout our sessions. Please re-familiarize yourself with these instructions.

Once you have read and understood the content of these three files, please confirm.

After your confirmation, we can continue working. Based on our last session and the `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` file, our current focus should be on **Designing and implementing command post range visualization for movement**.
